# Elevenlabs-Soundboard'
*Out of date readme. Basically install VB cable and replace api key with yours 

This is mainly meant for quick and lightweight creation of elevenlabs voice samples. To make it work with a sound board use VB cable and make a directory C:\Users\USER\OneDrive\Desktop\Soundboard. Then use the output of the VB cable as your mic to use the produced sounds
